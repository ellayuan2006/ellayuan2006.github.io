    <h1>issue #1 - 9/8/23</h1>
    <p>The first book I have chosen for this newsletter is Franny and Zooey by J.D. Salinger, which I read over the Summer. J.D. Salinger’s most famous book is The Catcher in the Rye. I haven’t read it! Not really in the mood to. Franny and Zooey is a much shorter story, 200 pages. It is split into 2 parts, the first focused on college student Franny, and the second on Franny and her older brother Zooey (short for Zachary). </p>
    <p>Franny and her many siblings, including Zooey, were former contestants on a game show of child geniuses. Now all grown up Franny is realizing her pretentiousness is apparent when interacting with other people, including her boyfriend and classmates. Franny’s dilemma is that she thinks she is smarter than everyone (and she probably is) so it is easy for her to criticize everyone else’s work/opinions, but then she gets so good at criticizing people that she starts doing it to herself. She starts criticizing herself for criticizing. Her first nature when confronted with anything is to find stupidity in it, so she effectively boxes herself into not doing anything because it will not be good enough in her eyes. The only thing worse than having a big ego is having a big ego but not making use of it. Having a just big enough ego where you secretly think highly of yourself but are too scared to do anything with it and let others see your strengths because you might simultaneously expose your flaws and you see this suppression as a failure which leads to more inward and outward hatred resulting in you talking down on people who are actually doing things and/or don’t have the self-deprecation that you associate with intelligence because it is the self-deprecation that you have and of course you are smart (in secret). This reminds me of school a lot! (I am not exempt from this) Anyways here are some quotes: </p>
    <p>“I'm sick of not having the courage to be an absolute nobody.”</p>
    <p>“I’m just sick of ego, ego, ego. My own and everybody else’s. I’m sick of everybody that wants to get somewhere, do something distinguished and all, be somebody interesting. It’s disgusting.”</p>
    <p>“It's everybody, I mean. Everything everybody does is so — I don't know — not wrong, or even mean, or even stupid necessarily. But just so tiny and meaningless and — sad-making. And the worst part is, if you go bohemian or something crazy like that, you're conforming just as much only in a different way.”</p>
    <p>Conclusion: have the courage to be an absolute nobody! Not to not have ambitions or dreams or whatever, but #1: Accept that most people aren’t going to become anyone important, which is fine! We need unimportant people. (Unimportant as in unimportant to the world, not unimportant to the people around you). Whether you try to become significant by being the best at something or significant by straying away from being the best at things people usually try to be the best at, you are trying to make your mark in the world in some way which is fine but you most likely won’t. #2 Have dreams/goals big or small, but actually do things to help you move towards them and never judge someone else's. Be kind and empathetic to everyone you meet, even if you think they are insignificant to your life.</p>
    <p>However, these 2 things are kind of contradictions. Don’t have unrealistic dreams but also don’t judge others unrealistic dreams? I think the remedy is in the last sentence, and the conclusion of Franny and Zooey. Maybe there is no solution to ego (or lack of it), maybe there is no cure for pretentiousness. But empathy and forming genuine connections with people is always the right thing to do.</p>
    <p>The book is pretty good! Read it if you want to. </p>
